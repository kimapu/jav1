Exercise for MS Access:

Create a MS Access database namely, DemoDB.accdb. 
	- Make a Staff table which contains ID, FNAME, LNAME, AGE, DOB, DEPARTMENT, DATE_JOINED, etc.

	- Make a Product table which contains ID, CODE, NAME, DESC, COST, RETAIL_PRICE, QUANTITY, etc.

Based on DemoDB.accdb, answer the following questions:

1. Write a program that views, inserts and updates staff information stored in a database.
2. Write a program that validates the customer login information. This program prompts the user for username and password input.
