Lab 11 – Java Collection Framework
Answer the following questions.

Exercise:

1.	Suppose that set1 is a set that contains the strings “red”, “yellow”, and “green”, and that set2 is another set that contains the strings “red”, “yellow”, and “blue”. Answer the following questions:
	a.	What are set1 and set2 after executing set1.addAll(set2)?
	b.	What are set1 and set2 after executing set1.add(set2)?
	c.	What are set1 and set2 after executing set1.removeAll(set2)?
	d.	What are set1 and set2 after executing set1.remove(set2)?
	e.	What are set1 and set2 after executing set1.retainAll(set2)?

2.	Suppose that list1 is a list that contains the strings “red”, “yellow”, and “green”, and that list2 is another list that contains the strings “red”, “yellow”, and “blue”. Answer the following questions.
	a.	What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.addAll(list2)?
	b.	What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.add(list2)?
	c.	What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.removeAll(list2)?
	d.	What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.remove(list2)?
	e.	What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.retainAll(list2)?

3.	Write a program that reads words from a text file and displays all the nonduplicate words in ascending order. 

4.	Write a program that reads words from a text file and displays all the words (duplicates allowed) in ascending alphabetical order.

5.	Write a program that lets the user enter a set of numbers on the console. Use a linked list to store the numbers. Do not store duplicate numbers. Add operations that sort, shuffle, and reverse the list.

6.	Write a program that demonstrates how to sort the elements in a tree set using the Comparator interface. The example creates a tree set of geometric objects. The geometric objects are sorted using the compare method in the Comparator interface based on their computed area. 

7.	Use the Collections class, find the minimum and maximum value in the list. Assume that the list is [2,12,98,77,55,34,7,23,5,33,77,89,12,34,5].
